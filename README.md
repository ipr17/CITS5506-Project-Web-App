## Content

This is the front-end dashboard for our IoT smart clothes drying rack.  

The page is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  

It connects to a Flask backend and Raspberry Pi to show real-time data and control the cover.

## Functions included in the web front end

1.Displaying live camera feed (`/video_feed`)

2.Showing real-time rack and weather status via `/api/status`:

  - Cover state: extended / retracted

  - Sunlight intensity (lux)

  - Rain detection status

  - Simple weather icon

3.Control buttons (POST to `/api/control`):

  - Extend / Retract cover

  - Start / Reset drying timer

  - Emergency manual close

4.Notification system:

  - Rain expected in 3 hours (Customizable)

  - (No rain expected in the next 12 hours ‚Äì suitable for drying)

---

## API Integration (for backend)


1.Get Status

### `GET /api/status`  

Called every 5 seconds to update the display.

Sample response:

```json

{
  "coverExtended": true,

  "sunlight": 150,

  "rainDetected": false,

  "weatherCondition": "sunny",

  "rainExpected": false,

  "rainHours": 0

}
```

2.Cover Control

### `POST /api/control`  

Sends a control command:

```json

{ "command": "up|down|manualClose" }  

```

Expected response:

```json

{ "success": true }

```

3.camera video

### `GET /video_feed`  

Returns MJPEG stream from Raspberry Pi camera.


## File Structure


- `index.html`: Contains all layout, styling, and interaction logic

  - No frameworks used (pure static HTML/JS)

  - Buttons use `fetch()` to talk to the backend

  - Timer is implemented with `setInterval()`


## Note

This file is about the front-end layout and logic for this version.  

Each feature is modular and can be tweaked based on our feedback.

> I'm happy to adjust layout/styling if needed.  


## Frontend & UI 


UI Design Principles

Theme:  Milky white & yellow color (maybe) clean, fresh look

Layout: Modular, card-style layout

Technology:

Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Performance: fast-loading for Raspberry Pi hosting.
